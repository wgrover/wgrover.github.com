**Blender animation of cell density measurement**

dxf2fgc reads in a DXF CAD file containing circles at the locations where holes are to be drilled, and generates a G-Code file which can be run on a CNC mill to drill the wafer.

This code has been mostly replaced by the newer Modrilla (above), but I keep the [LabVIEW source for dxf2fgc](http://github.com/wgrover/dxf2fgc) (along with a [manual](http://github.com/wgrover/dxf2fgc/raw/master/dxf2fgc.pdf) that may be helpful to anyone interested in drilling holes in glass) on Github.
