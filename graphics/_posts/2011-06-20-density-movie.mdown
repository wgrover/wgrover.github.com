I created this animation to accompany [our *PNAS* paper about measuring the density of single cells](http://wgrover.com/research/2011/06/20/cell-density.html).  Several people have asked me how I made the animation, so here are a few notes on the process and the tools I used.

I made the animation using the free open source 3D modeling software [Blender](http://www.blender.org/).
