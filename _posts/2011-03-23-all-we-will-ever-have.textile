At the end of last week, I "tried":http://al3x.net/2011/03/18/not-a-waste.html to convey my perspective on a particular and narrow category of entrepreneurship that I do not believe is optimal. I stand by what I had to say, but the way in which I said it at the time was not effective. Such is the nature of debating challenging ideas: the burden is on the challenger.

At the very least, the exchange was food for thought. It helped me realize what's worth arguing about through words and what's worth arguing about through action.

Just as I was wrapping up a day of minor sound and fury over my post and comment, I found out that someone very close to me was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. This person may not live to see the end of the year.

In light of that news, I'll leave the "words" portion of this discussion with a quote from the poet "Philip Appleman":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Appleman:

bq. "Whatever we are, whatever we make of ourselves, is all we will ever have â€“ and that, in its profound simplicity, is the meaning of life."
