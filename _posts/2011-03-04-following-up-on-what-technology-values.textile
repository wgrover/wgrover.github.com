title: "Following Up On What Technology Values"
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

If you enjoyed my post on "what technology values":http://al3x.net/2011/02/21/technology-and-values.html and you have about half an hour to listen to two people talk, you'll probably enjoy this "interview":http://www.themachinestarts.com/read/26 I did for a new whip-smart blog and podcast called "The Machine Starts":http://www.themachinestarts.com/.

The interview starts with a brief discussion of how social networks fit into society and our identities, but then gets into issues of disconnecting from social technology, who businesses should be building technology for, technology's role in the current revolutions in the Middle East, and the philosophy and morality of our industry. All in all, a broad discussion that I'm near-totally unqualified to be mouthing off about but had a ton of fun with.

Thanks to Chris at "The Machine Starts":http://www.themachinestarts.com/ for the opportunity.
