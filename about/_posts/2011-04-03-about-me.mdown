----------------

I'm a Research Associate in [Scott Manalis' group](http://manalis-lab.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Biological Engineering](http://web.mit.edu/be/) and the [David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research](http://ki.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu).  I received my PhD in Chemistry from the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) in [Richard Mathies' group](http://endlesstrek.com/), and my BS in Chemistry from the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](http://www.utk.edu).

Right now I'm developing microfluidic tools for precisely measuring the fundamental physical properties (such as mass, volume, and density) of single living cells. Working with biologists and doctors, we've found that these physical properties correlate well with cell disease states, so our tools for measuring physical properties have interesting diagnostic and analytical applications.
