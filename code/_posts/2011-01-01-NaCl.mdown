**Python code for precisely calculating the density of sodium chloride solutions**

Given the mass of water combined with the mass of sodium chloride at a given temperature, *NaCl* will calculate the density of the resulting solution.

The [Python source code](http://github.com/wgrover/NaCl) is available on Github.
