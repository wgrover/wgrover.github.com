We have used a microfluidic mass sensor to measure the density of single living cells.  By weighing each cell in two fluids of different densities, our technique measures the single-cell mass, volume, and density of approximately 500 cells per hour with a density precision of 0.001 g/mL.  We observe that the intrinsic cell-to-cell variation in density is nearly 100-fold smaller than the mass or volume variation.  As a result, we can measure changes in cell density indicative of cellular processes that would be otherwise undetectable by mass or volume measurements.  Here we demonstrate this with four examples:  identifying *P. falciparum* malaria-infected erythrocytes in a culture, distinguishing transfused blood cells from a patientâ€™s own blood, identifying irreversibly-sickled cells in a sickle cell patient, and identifying leukemia cells in the early stages of responding to a drug treatment.   These demonstrations suggest that the ability to measure single cell density will provide valuable insights into cell state for a wide range of biological processes.
